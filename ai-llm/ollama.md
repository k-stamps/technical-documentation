## Run Ollama LLMs Locally

How to run free open-Source LLMs on your computer with Ollama (Windows):

### Ollama:
Ollama is an independent startup that provides downloads of free open-source LLMs (Large Language Models).

### Download Ollama:
* Go to https://ollama.com/
* Click “Download”
* Click “Download for Windows”
* Run the downloaded exe file to install Ollama locally

### Run an LLM:
* In the start menu of your computer, search for “powershell” and select the Windows PowerShell application to open it.
* Type 
```ollama run llama3.2```
and hit Enter. Llama 3.2 is Meta’s open source LLM.
* It will download the 2 billion parameters in a series of lines
* Once it outputs “success” then the Ollama LLM is running.

### Interact with the LLM:
* When you see a blinking cursor, it is ready for you to interact with it.
* Ask the LLM a question or for help with something. It will give answers and responses. This free and open source LLM is running on your own machine.
* To exit the LLM, type
```/bye or Ctrl + d```

### Try other Ollama LLMs:
* To compare this model to other Ollama models, visit https://ollama.com/ and select the Models navigation item. There will be a list of models you can read about.
* Warning: llama models that are more recent (higher number) than 3.2 are generally too big to run on a home computer.
* To run one of these other LLMs, visit its detail page, and click the copy icon to copy the command to run that LLM in your Windows PowerShell.
